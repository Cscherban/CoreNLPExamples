# CoreNLPExamples
Learning Stanfords CoreNLP Library


The following examples are from an IntelliJ projet where we go through the basic examples provided by Stanford,
and then expand upon them to create something cool. Each step along the way will be documented and explained. 

The final project will be an analysis of a Tale of Two Cities.

# Setup

In order to get Stanford's CoreNLP working, follow the instructions [here](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/). 

Once you have downloaded the set of Jar files, for the programs we go through, you will need to set the English 
and English KBP model jars as the stanford-corenlp-version_number-models and stanford-corenlp-version_number-models jars 
as dependencies in the project.
